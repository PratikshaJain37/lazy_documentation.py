Line 2 - For Loop: Iterating in *range (t)* 



Approach 1:

A cell (X,Y) can be visited if max(∣X−r∣,∣Y−c∣)<=K




Line 12 - For Loop: Iterating in *range(1,9)* 
Line 13 - For Loop: Iterating in *range(1,9)* 
Line 14 - If Condition:  max(abs(x-r), abs(y-c))<=k




Approach 2:


The possible cells king can visit will form a square (or rectangle, depending on where he is placed). The area of this figure is the answer.

dx and dy are length of horizontal and vertical sides of rectangle

The +1+1+1 in the formula is to account for the row/column the king is standing it.
