MultiLineComment:
The possible cells king can visit will form a square (or rectangle, depending on where he is placed). The area of this figure is the answer.
dx and dy are length of horizontal and vertical sides of rectangle
The +1+1+1 in the formula is to account for the row/column the king is standing it.
